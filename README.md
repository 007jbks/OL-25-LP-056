## 📝 Project Description

This project aims to understand key factors influencing mental health among tech employees and build data-driven solutions for improving workplace well-being. It uses machine learning techniques to perform classification, regression, and clustering tasks and presents results via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

### Objectives

To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and build data-driven solutions for:

-   **Classification Task:** Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment.
-   **Regression Task:** Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design.
-   **Unsupervised Task:** Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies.
